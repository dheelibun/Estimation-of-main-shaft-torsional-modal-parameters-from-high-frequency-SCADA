# Estimation-of-main-shaft-torsional-modal-parameters-from-high-frequency-SCADA

There are two matlab files in the repository. One named Collage_method.m can be used for estimating the main shaft torsional modal parameters given the rotor, generator speeds and generator power. The other matlab code 'Tikhonov_regukarisation.m' can be used to obtain the torsional displacement from the torsional velocity. More details about the methodoolgy can be found in the following article.
